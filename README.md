## Overview

In the previous task, you created an array of Pok√©mon in a pokemonList variable. In this task, you‚Äôll be asked to create a for loop to iterate over each object within that array. You‚Äôll also practice using conditional statements.

### Directions:

#### Part 1

Below the pokemonList array in your ‚Äúscripts.js‚Äù file, create a for loop that iterates over each item in pokemonList:

Use document.write() inside the loop‚Äôs code to write the Pok√©mon name on your website‚Äôs DOM.
Use what you‚Äôve learned about adding strings in JavaScript to write the Pok√©mon‚Äôs height next to its name, for example, ‚ÄúBulbasaur (height: 7)‚Äù.

#### Part 2

You should now be able to open the ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù of your project in the browser and see a list of Pok√©mon appear. Work with the inspector and JavaScript console of your Developer Tools to see if there are any errors in your code. You can also use the Web Inspector to adjust your CSS and make things look nicer.

#### Part 3

Next, add code to highlight special Pok√©mon in your list. Be sure to keep adding comments to explain and document what your code does. Within the loop, add a conditional. The conditional should check if the height is above a certain value (you‚Äôre free to pick whatever value you want). If it is, add the note ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs big!‚Äù to the output. Make sure you set up the conditional so that only one Pok√©mon has the label ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs big!‚Äù It could, for example, look like this: ‚ÄúBulbasaur (height: 7) - Wow, that‚Äôs big!‚Äù. For example, if you had the following array:

Array displaying name, height and types for Bulbasaur, Charizard and Squirtle


And the threshold value were 1.0, you'd get something like this:

List with names and heights for Bulbasaur, Charizard and Squirtle

### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ')
}
```
