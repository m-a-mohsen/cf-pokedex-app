## Overview

"You‚Äôve spent this Exercise learning about both primitive and complex data types. In the task for this Exercise, you'll use what you‚Äôve learned to build the data set of your application in preparation for what you‚Äôll be doing in the next Exercise.

As mentioned before, you'll be building a Pok√©dex as an example application, listing Pok√©mon and information about them. If you need a refresher on the project, have a look at the Achievement 1 project brief. Later in this Achievement, you'll get the chance to build a similar application with a different type of data.

Let‚Äôs build your repository!

Directions

1- Open the ‚Äúscripts.js‚Äù file of your project and remove all existing code. You're going to set up your application from scratch. As you work on your project, don‚Äôt forget to regularly commit your changes on GitHub with meaningful commit messages and add comments to explain and document what your code does. (When you use a project from your portfolio for a job application, the recruiter will most likely take a look at the commit history of your project. They'll want to see that you know how to use Git and that you can write meaningful commit messages, as they're crucial when working in teams and on large projects.).

2- Create a new variable called pokemonList and assign to it a blank array. This array contains Pok√©mon data to display in your application.

3- Now, add several objects to the array. Each object represents one Pok√©mon and needs to have the same keys to avoid errors. Add at least the following three keys to each Pok√©mon object and make up a value for each of them: name (make this a string, e.g., "Bulbasaur"), height (this will be a number, e.g., 7) and types (make this an array of strings, e.g., ['grass', 'poison']). You can use Pokedex.org as a reference. Create at least three Pok√©mon objects in your pokemonList array.

4- Save the changes, then commit and push them to your GitHub repository.

5- Submit the link to your GitHub repository here. Feel free to share additional thoughts or ask questions on your submissions page."

### The challenge

- Discuss JavaScript primitive and complex data types as well as how and why they're used.
- Practice creating and adding data to arrays.

### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ')
}
```
